Project 7- React Gallery App

In this project, I used the React library to create an image gallery app. I utilized functional components and React Hooks to initialize and modify state instead of using class components. This allowed me to more efficiently manage state and increase code readability.  

Instructions to add API key:
-Create .env file in root folder
-In .env file, input API key as "REACT_APP_FLICKR_KEY=your API"
-Save .env file
